<p class="SECTION-HEADING">User management for cybersecurity </p>
<p>Recommendations for user management: </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Create individual Windows users for each user that will need access 
	 to Ortho System. The users can be created locally or as domain users 
	 (e.g., using Active Directory). </li>
	<li>The user accounts should be required to have a strong password, 
	 and the password is required to be changed at regular time intervals. 
	 </li>
	<li>Configure each user account to ensure that the user only has access 
	 to the parts of Ortho System needed for that particular user. This 
	 can be supported by creating specific user roles with the standard 
	 access predefined, e.g., by using security groups in Active Directory. 
	 </li>
	<li>Configure each user account to only allow the user to change computer 
	 settings for that particular user. </li>
	<li>Configure each user account to automatically apply a screen lock 
	 after a fixed amount of time with no activity on the PC, and to enforce 
	 the use of a password for unlocking the PC.</li>
	<li>Inform each user about the ability to lock the screen manually 
	 using the <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Windows</span><span> 
	 +</span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> L</span> 
	 key combination, and implement procedures for that the screen is manually 
	 locked if the PC is left unattended. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p class="SECTION-HEADING">Device management and device maintenance for 
 cybersecurity</p>
<p>Recommendations for device management: </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Follow recommendations from Microsoft regarding settings and configuration 
	 for the Windows system. </li>
	<li>Keep the Windows system updated with latest patches and upgrades 
	 provided by Microsoft. It is recommended to setup Windows to download 
	 and install latest patches and updates automatically. </li>
	<li>When necessary, keep track of the security patches that have been 
	 installed, and if they have been installed correctly. The Windows 
	 system upgrade history is shown in the Windows system log. The Ortho 
	 System upgrade history is shown in the install log file located at 
	 <span style="font-style: italic;">C:\Program Files\3Shape\OrthoSystem\InstallationLog.txt</span>. 
	 </li>
	<li>To get an overview of which version of the software was installed, 
	 click the 3Shape logo in the bottom right corner of the session window. 
	 The versions of subsystems to be installed are shown when running 
	 the Ortho System installer. </li>
	<li>Keep other parts of the system (drivers, etc.) updated with latest 
	 patches and upgrades provided by the system vendor. </li>
	<li>Make sure to have an updated and efficient virus protection system 
	 installed. </li>
	<li>Avoid using the Windows system for anything that is not strictly 
	 needed or related to the use of Ortho System. </li>
	<li>Perform a system settings backup at regular intervals. The <span>Ortho 
	 settings are</span> backed up by performing a full copy of the folder 
	 <span style="font-style: italic;">C:\ProgramData\3Shape\OrthoSystemMaterials\Backup</span>. 
	 </li>
	<li>Back up the data and perform the disaster recovery for Ortho System. 
	 The method to back up the system using the Dental Desktop module and 
	 the &quot;classic&quot; standalone version in Ortho System is described 
	 in the Technical Guidelines.</li>
</ul>
